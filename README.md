# Public Time-Log of Michael Pilosov

This document was generated using some modifications to [Watson](https://github.com/TailorDev/Watson) and synchronized using GitHub instead of the built-in functionality. 

The primary purpose of this effort is to make my time completely transparent in order to hold myself accountable.
My goal is to work at least 40 hours a week, split evenly between Thesis and NSF grant work (during the Spring 2019 semester), with 4-6 hours/week devoted to professional development efforts (job search, website refinement).
