# Public Time-Log of Michael Pilosov

This document was generated using some modifications to [Watson](https://github.com/TailorDev/Watson).

The primary purpose of this effort is to make my time completely transparent in order to hold myself accountable during one of the most important semesters of my life.

My goal is to work at least 40 hours a week, split evenly between Thesis and NSF grant work (during the Spring 2019 semester), with 4-6 hours/week devoted to professional development efforts (job search, website refinement, etc.). 

Ideally, my use of this project will continue in perpetuity.
