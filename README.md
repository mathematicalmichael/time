# Public Time-Log of Michael Pilosov

This document was generated using some modifications to [Watson](https://github.com/TailorDev/Watson).

The primary purpose of this effort is to make my time completely transparent in order to hold myself accountable during one of the most important semesters of my life.

My goal is to work at least 40 hours a week, split evenly between Thesis and NSF grant work (during the Spring 2019 semester), with 4-6 hours/week devoted to professional development efforts (job search, website refinement, etc.). 

Ideally, my use of this project will continue in perpetuity.

## Structure

The `self` branch is where I do my tracking of time. The `master` one will remain clean, and you are welcome to fork the project for yourself and start tracking your time! 


# Setup

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork.
3. Checkout a new branch for your personal time.
4. Use `watson start/stop` to track your time. 
5. Run `./update.sh` to generate a summary (you may want to edit `gen_summary.sh`) and push the changes live to github.
